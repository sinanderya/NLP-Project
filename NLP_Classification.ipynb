On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:\\n1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this \\n2. Dana kaburga\\n3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)\\n\\nI think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. \\n\\nI def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More',\n",

On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:\\n1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this \\n2. Dana kaburga\\n3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)\\n\\nI think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. \\n\\nI def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More',\n",

Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. \\n\\nI def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More',\n",

But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!!

On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:\\n1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this \\n2. Dana kaburga\\n3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)\\n\\nI think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. \\n\\nI def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More',\n",

On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:\\n1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this \\n2. Dana kaburga\\n3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)\\n\\nI think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. \\n\\nI def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More',\n",

We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More\",\n",

       "  'reviews': 'We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:\\n1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this \\n2. Dana kaburga\\n3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)\\n\\nI think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. \\n\\nI def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More',\n",

The only downside is they dont serve liquor. At the main Nusret, it is a herding...of people - poor service and no time for the guests. One is made to feel lucky to have been given a table and food. The main Nusret I knew from yester years was one of excellent food and service and welcoming. Recommend go to the smaller Nusret outlets - will be very good and usually u will not have to make a reservation though advance reservation is recommended. .More',\n",
