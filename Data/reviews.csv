0,what a disgrace,The prices have doubled up while the quantity  and quality of the food deteriorated. DISAPPOINTED 😡😡,2
1,Way overrated!,Despite the hype and the great ambience the food was quite overrated! The meat was too fatty and was not properly cooked to our order. The service was great and the team were super helpful and friendly.,3
2,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
3,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty. 

I def recommend everyone to try this!! i think the price is still reasonable (they have variety of price) considering how good the food is and the overall experience.More",5
4,dinner twice - once near the Grand Bazar outlet and next at the main Nusret,"Food at the Grand Bazar outlet was wonderful (true to the old Nusret I knew) as was the service - the time and attention and recommendations was so good. The only downside is they dont serve liquor. At the main Nusret, it is a herding...of people - poor service and no time for the guests. One is made to feel lucky to have been given a table and food. The main Nusret I knew from yester years was one of excellent food and service and welcoming. Recommend go to the smaller Nusret outlets - will be very good and usually u will not have to make a reservation though advance reservation is recommended. .More",4

227,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
228,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

Price is not expensive
I would visit it again 
I visit the grand bazar restaurant",5
302,Excellent for just one try,"It was my second time in Nusret.
I should confess that the first time was more attractive to me.
First time I went there, the atmosphere and style caught my eye . I had fun and of course the quality of food was good.
This...time I focus  on quality .
My steak was still was good but just good and very expensive for istanbul.

303,Way better than expected!!,"Although I was afraid that it would be a rather overrated restaurant, it was excellent. The food was delicious, and the service exceptional. It was crowded, but somehow the stuff managed to find a table for everyone in a few minutes.

307,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good.

308,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

457,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good.

458,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

I should confess that the first time was more attractive to me.

We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good.

On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!!

When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
608,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

687,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
688,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
838,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

I should confess that the first time was more attractive to me.

913,Way better than expected!!,"Although I was afraid that it would be a rather overrated restaurant, it was excellent. The food was delicious, and the service exceptional. It was crowded, but somehow the stuff managed to find a table for everyone in a few minutes.

914,Real good!,We had a lovely night out in the city and this restaurant was soo good. It was crowded and full of energy and we really loved it. Definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone.,5

917,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
918,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

1067,Great Dining Experience,"I have visited Nusret inside the Grand Bazaar and also at the main location in Istanbul. Each time I have visited these restaurants I have never left disappointed. We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
1068,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

I would visit it again 
I visit the grand bazar restaurant",5
1142,Excellent for just one try,"It was my second time in Nusret.
I should confess that the first time was more attractive to me.
First time I went there, the atmosphere and style caught my eye . I had fun and of course the quality of food was good.

My steak was still was good but just good and very expensive for istanbul.

1143,Way better than expected!!,"Although I was afraid that it would be a rather overrated restaurant, it was excellent. The food was delicious, and the service exceptional. It was crowded, but somehow the stuff managed to find a table for everyone in a few minutes.

Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.

We have tried the lamb chops with fries, a steak dish, a hamburger, salad, etc. Everything has...always tasted fresh and the service is very good. When dining don't miss trying the baklava with vanilla ice cream. It's not to be missed and tastes really good. I will keep returning when visiting Istanbul.More",5
1218,MUST VISIT,"We came here twice because on our first visit we only tried one menu since we are still full from our previous meal. On both visit, we ordered an onion flower, the first one sure tasted better because the second one is very oily I...can feel it on my throat, we didnt finish that. Moving on, overall we tried three courses:
1. Kuzu kafes (lamb) --> you got the slicing show if u order this 
2. Dana kaburga
3. Nusret special (if im not mistaken)

I think dana kaburga and nusret special are my two favs and will def order again if i come back to turkey. Both meet are SUPER SOFT, i didnt even use the knife to cut it!! But I think my best choice would be the nusret special because it is less oily and how its mixed with the bread and the smell of the butter is a perfect combination!! Also, I saw a lot of people ordering it so it must be one of their specials. of course we closed our meal with baklava!! this is my fav baklava out of many baklavas i tried in turkey, combined with the ice cream ugh so good and fresh!! I went there twice (weekdays tho) and no queue (the place is huge, the one near grand bazar)!! Plus value because the waiters are handy and fast so your table will not be dirty.
